# emergent-behavior

a collection of some of my favorite examples of emergent behavior in simple deterministic systems

### langton's ant
* rules
  * 1. At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
  * 2. At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* math
  * universal Turing machine
* code
* example

### conway's game of life
* rules
  * 1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
  * 2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
  * 3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
* math
  * Turing machine
* code
* example
* emergent behaviors
  * three types: *static*, *oscillators*, *spaceships*
  * complex emergent behaviors: *replicators*
  * this is an example of Gosper's glider gun; a cellular automaton pattern with a main part that repeats periodically, like an oscillator, and that also periodically emits spaceships.
